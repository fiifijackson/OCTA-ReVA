# OCTA-ReVA
## Overview
OCTA-ReVA (Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography - Retinal Vessel Analyzer) is an open-source platform designed for the automated extraction and quantitative analysis of OCTA features. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface built with MATLAB, facilitating detailed and non-invasive analysis of retinal blood vessels which is crucial for studying and diagnosing eye diseases.

## Features
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Intuitive design with buttons, dropdown menus, and real-time visualization panels.\

**Supports Single and Batch Processing**: Enhanced utility for handling large-scale studies.\
**Flexible Binarization Techniques**: Includes several methods such as Otsu, fixed, mean, median, and 3-sigma thresholding to suit diverse analytical needs.\
**Export Option**s: Allows saving of analysis results directly into Excel format and optional exporting of intermediate images.

## Usage
1. Start the OCTA-ReVA Toolbox from the MATLAB command window.
2. Load OCTA images by specifying the directory containing the images.
3. Configure analysis parameters such as plexus layer, scan size, and binarization technique.
4. Click "Apply" to start the analysis.
5. Review and save the results as needed.
